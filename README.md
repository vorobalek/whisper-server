# Whisper Server

## Overview

Whisper Server is the server-side reference implementation of the Whisper protocol, which powers the [Whisper Messenger client](https://github.com/vorobalek/whisper-client). It provides a protocol-only backend for end-to-end encrypted real-time communication without any content retention or decryption capabilities.
